**FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE** <br>
_From the Desk of the Intern_

As we enter our inaugural season of speculative leadership, we at **Bulls Back Office** want to thank Bulls Nation for their continued support.

While we lack access, credentials, and relevant experience, we nonetheless endeavor to deliver the same _coherent planning_ you've come to expect from our Front Office.

We remain committed to our vision: **tracksuit executives, one couch away from a champion**.

We're the tail that wags the dog; the caboose running the train. We ask our fans for patience during this first year of transition...

â€” Bulls Back Office
