### The Problem

Forty-six games into the NBA season and the Bulls are struggling on the defensive end. They currently rank 24th in defense and are giving up an average of 119.9 points per game to opponents. The question is what can be done within the current confines of the roster to produce a better defensive product? While the Bulls have a few stand out defensive players such as [Isaac Okoro](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/o/okorois01.html) and [Jalen Smith](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/s/smithja04.html), most of their heavy minutes players struggle on that end such as [Coby White](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/w/whiteco01.html), [Josh Giddey](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/g/giddejo01.html), [Kevin Huerter](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/h/huertke01.html) and [Nikola Vucevic](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/v/vucevni01.html). Most of their role players fall somewhere in the middle with [Patrick Williams](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/w/willipa01.html), [Tre Jones](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/j/jonestr01.html), [Matas Buzelis](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/b/buzelma01.html), [Ayo Dosunmu](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/d/dosunay01.html), and [Zach Collins](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/c/colliza01.html) all being somewhat impactful on defense. With a decent amount of capable defenders on this team, one may wonder why the defensive side of the ball has been a struggle this year. Is the problem the defensive scheme? Is it all the switching the Bulls do? Is the pace of play generating too many possessions for the Bulls to hold up defensively? Maybe, but a major problem is the lack of lineup creativity to get enough defense on the floor for a team that is attempting to build an identity of fast paced offense. 

According to [NBA.com](https://www.nba.com/stats/lineups/advanced?CF=MIN*GE*20&GroupQuantity=5&TeamID=1610612741&dir=A&slug=advanced&sort=DEF_RATING), the Bulls’ main starting lineup of Josh Giddey, Coby White, Isaac Okoro, Matas Buzelis, and Nikola Vucevic has a 121.7 offensive rating in 90 minutes of play (as of this writing). That is positive offensive production, however their defensive rating is 122.4, which is horrendous. They are relying on out-scoring their opponents on a nightly basis, but they struggle to do so because they give up more than they score. Due to heavy minutes with this lineup, Okoro’s individual defensive rating is a team worst 120.1. This shows how difficult it is for his defensive capabilities to shine through while he is handicapped by playing alongside poor defenders. On the surface, it is easy to see why Head Coach Billy Donovan plays this lineup. Josh Giddey is the star do it all offensive point guard who was just given a contract extension. Coby White is the primary scorer, with an ability to create offense for himself that is far beyond any other member of the team. Matas Buzelis is a promising young player in his second year that the franchise is developing. Nikola Vucevic is a veteran big man whose solid offensive play and resume with the Bulls make him an easy candidate to start at center. Isaac Okoro is the defensive glue guy who “rounds out” the lineup by being the point of attack defender and physical presence. This lineup narratively makes sense, but a closer look at its impact raises questions about the defensive side of the ball. A possible solution to this defensive issue involves interchanging lineups to have more quality defenders take the floor at the same time.

### The Solution 

The center position is the obvious place to start. While Nikola Vucevic has had some huge offensive games and clutch performances this year, his defense has been a problem. As the backline help, his lack of helpside rim protection and poor pick & roll defense has hurt this team tremendously on defense. Nikola Vucevic has a 117.2 defensive rating (via NBA.com) and a -0.2 DLEBRON (via [nbarapm.com](https://nbarapm.com/player/Nikola_Vucevic)), which is below average. Meanwhile, his backup/frontcourt partner is Jalen Smith, who has been an advanced metrics darling for the Bulls this year. His defensive rating is a 112.8 and his DLEBRON is 1.3. Jalen is a springy, gazelle-like, big man whose athleticism allows him to cover ground that Vucevic is unable to. He also provides more switchability and better pick & roll defense than Vucevic, which makes him an all around better option defensively and the numbers reflect that. 

Although not the analytical darling that Jalen Smith is, Isaac Okoro is a talented individual defender in his own right. This can be reflected in his dTS% which sits at a 0.6, implying that his matchups shoot below their usual averages when guarded by Okoro. A prime example of this is how he has matched up with All-NBA shooting guard Anthony Edwards this season. In the Bulls’ two games against Edwards’ Timberwolves, Okoro has held Edwards to 0/7 from the field. In a similar vein, he has held Celtics superstar Jaylen Brown to 3/13 from the field in their two matchups. Okoro is often the Bulls best option against some of the elite offensive players in the league, but is often held back by poor helpside, switching, and poor pick & roll navigation by those he is most often in lineups with. 

This raises the question, what would happen if Isaac Okoro had more defensive help on the floor with him? The results become very positive. Lineups where Okoro and Jalen Smith share the floor have a defensive rating of 114.7 over 248 minutes played together. This number is closer to average, which is still a big jump up from the starting five with Okoro alone. Bulls’ lineups with Okoro and Smith still maintain a 123.1 offensive rating, which is very good and gives the Bulls a net rating of 8.4. Playing Smith and Okoro together does not hurt the offense at all and helps the defense immensely, and we have a large sample size depicting that to be true.

Let’s take it a step further by adding another good defender in Patrick Williams into the mix. In 34 minutes across 16 games (admittedly a much smaller sample size), they have an offensive rating of 127.3 which is downright incredible. More importantly, the trio of Okoro, Smith, and Williams has a defensive rating of 84.4 which is spectacular and results in a positive net rating of 42.9. Despite the reputations of Okoro and Williams being poor offensive players, this lineup thrives on both sides of the ball. Defense turns to offense and they play at an incredibly high pace of 107.6 (via NBA.com). They turn defense to offense by forcing tough shots and getting out in transition. Okoro and Williams are capable of bodying up good perimeter players while Smith patrols the paint and provides backline rim protection. This is a lineup the Bulls have not utilized enough this season.

It works for other combinations of solid defenders as well. Okoro, Smith, and Ayo Dosunmu lineups boast an impressive 122.5 offensive rating and a 107.2 defensive rating. Another extremely net positive lineup over a large sample size of 110 minutes. Adding Matas Buzelis to the duo of Smith and Okoro provides similar results with a 123.9 offensive rating and a 112.0 defensive rating over 179 minutes played. An interesting ripple with this lineup is the pace drops all the way to 98.8, potentially a sign that slowing the pace down and limiting the number of possessions in the game can help the Bulls’ defense out. There are clear signs of this Bulls team being able to play solid defense, but they need to get creative with how they platoon their defenders on the floor.

### Conclusion

The Bulls have shown the ability to play good defense at times, but they need to do a better job of recognizing which lineups and player combinations lead to positive defensive outcomes. They need to prioritize the defensive end. Offense is only as good as the defense behind it. The game of basketball is about two things: putting the ball in the hoop, and stopping the other team from putting the ball in the hoop. The Bulls treat the game like its 80% offense 20% defense. They must stop looking at Okoro and Williams as players who cannot see the floor together because of their perceived lack of offense, and instead throw them on the floor together for defensive purposes. Playing those two alongside Coby White and Josh Giddey still leaves plenty of offense on the floor. There are zero minutes of the Giddey-White-Okoro-Williams-Smith lineup this season, which is an example of a lineup that could perform well defensively without losing offensive firepower. Billy Donovan and his staff need to look internally and commit to more minutes with these defensive-minded combinations on the floor. 

So what does this mean for the Bulls? It means the Bulls have the personnel to put out a better defense than they have this season. Billy Donovan needs to get more creative with his lineups and utilize his defenders more. This might mean sacrificing some offense by reducing minutes from Kevin Huerter and more for Williams. It might mean playing White and Giddey with each other less. It might mean lowering Vucevic’s minutes as a whole and giving Smith more time on the floor. These are rotational trends that must be recognized and adjustments must be made accordingly to improve the defensive output of this team. If the Bulls claim to want to be as competitive as possible with their current roster, prioritizing defense should be at the top of the list, and playing different lineups can positively impact their defensive production.
