**The Duh Tier**
1. [Cooper Flagg](https://www.tankathon.com/players/cooper-flagg)
1. [Dylan Harper](https://www.tankathon.com/players/dylan-harper)

First up, the Duh Tier. Bulls have no shot at getting either of these guys but I mention them here for completeness. With Cooper... _maybe_ his 3pt% could be better? BUT THAT'S IT. He's as NBA-ready as it gets. Fuck you, Dallas :D Dylan is, of course, the son of Bulls great, Ron Harper, and making his Pops proud.

**The Trade Up Tier**
1. [V.J. Edgecombe](https://www.tankathon.com/players/v-j-edgecombe) ATHLETE! high flyer that can defend and kinda shoot. Interesting but pass
1. [Tre Johnson](https://www.tankathon.com/players/tre-johnson) BUCKET! Silky at all the shit. Shot on a string; can D; skinny 6'6 but damn
1. [Kon Knueppel](https://www.tankathon.com/players/kon-knueppel) shooter/scorer with size and a bit of stuff.
1. [Ace Bailey](https://www.tankathon.com/players/ace-bailey) fucking WOW athlete... skinny shot blocking 6'8 sf? Has the tools to be good. Needs a better handle

I don't expect any of these guys to be a Bull. Yes, yes... I've heard the rumors of the Bulls trading up for Ace :rolleyes: NOT HAPPENING. The front office would be dumb to trade away assets for a _maybe_. Ace is my least favorite in this tier because I like team-first kinda guys; guys that always play @ 100%. Ace is neither of those.

**Bulls Tier**
1. [Rasheer Fleming](https://www.tankathon.com/players/rasheer-fleming) 20.9yo (170 days older than DQ), athletic dunky/blocky/shooty with wingspan for days; great D; 39% from 3 on 4 attempts; a fucking LOAD; switchable 4/5... BULLS-TAKE: this is my guy if we pick 10th or 15th. Will anchor the defense and maybe DPOY potential
1. [Thomas Sorber](https://www.tankathon.com/players/thomas-sorber) XL block machine; D looks good; good feet; switchable; less fluid than Rasheer but BIG. Maybe 10 lbs too heavy? Can't shoot yet.
1. [Noa Essengue](https://www.tankathon.com/players/noa-essengue) young, SKINNY 6'10 athletic F; nice bag; good instincts; can pass; really creative finisher. Gonna need at LEAST 15lbs. Shot (30%) is slow but not horrible. Good defender... I like everything about this kid he pops in film... you notice him a LOT
1. [Derik Queen](https://www.tankathon.com/players/derik-queen) SOFT hands scorer; passing; handle; touch... D should be better. BULLS-TAKE: he shows flashes of disruptive D... if that ever becomes consistent, this kid's a monster. Otherwise I don't love his fit on the Bulls but I like his value. He's a star
1. [Cedric Coward](https://www.tankathon.com/players/cedric-coward) older wing that is a fucking ATHLETE. Wingspan! Can shoot, pressure the rim and a decent passer
1. [Carter Bryant](https://www.tankathon.com/players/carter-bryant)6'8 wing; athletic finisher that can put it on the floor. Decent shooting; great D; bit of a shot blocker; limited rebounding. He's good not great
1. [Danny Wolf](https://www.tankathon.com/players/danny-wolf) will be a quality backup C, especially if he can shoot 40% from 3
1. [Asa Newell](https://www.tankathon.com/players/asa-newell) tall bouncy baller; good D; he's a center; needs 10lbs and work on his shot but this is a guy BULLS-TAKE: Rasheer is better and will fit better
1. [Nique Clifford](https://www.tankathon.com/players/nique-clifford) - old but a do-it-all wing; some hops, can shoot; good D; nice player. BULLS-TAKE: not a _need_... but a baller
1. [Joan Beringer](https://www.tankathon.com/players/joan-beringer) 6'10, 230; mobile rim runner; nice footwork; mostly non-shooter (0 from 3%; 570% ft) but CAN hit an open look inside the arc. I like the defense... can stay in front; decent shot blocker. JT Toppin

At least one of these guys will be a Bull this year... it's anyone's guess which. If I had to bet _TODAY_, I'm betting Cedric Coward? He fills a real need at the wing, is a sexy pick and looks to have serious upside.

**2nd Round**
1. [Rocco Zikarsky](https://www.tankathon.com/players/rocco-zikarsky) skinny 7'3 aussie; discount Maluach; great feet; natural shot-blocker; needs 20lbs to be a better rebounder... has SOME offense some shooting some handle
1. [Drake Powell](https://www.tankathon.com/players/drake-powell) is a guy.  6'5 guard with CRAZY vert; has to be 40+. Defense is scary good. Slasher with an okay shot... @11silencioso11 I'm 99% sure you're gonna love this dude
1. [Adou Thiero](https://www.tankathon.com/players/adou-thiero) older bouncy 6'8 220 F. Good D; athlete; can't shoot and the shot looks like shit...
1. [Ryan Nembhard](https://www.tankathon.com/players/ryan-nembhard)
1. [Hansen Yang](https://www.tankathon.com/players/hansen-yang) 7'2 center; VERY skilled; great footwork; great bag in the post. Bit of a shot blocker and a nice passer. Can _kinda_ shoot 3s but not really. Like a quicker/better passing Edey?
1. [Yanic Konan Niederhauser](https://www.tankathon.com/players/yanic-konan-niederhauser) athletic 7 footer that is mobile as hell. I NEED MORE FILM :D
1. [Alex Condon](https://www.tankathon.com/players/alex-condon) FL/OZ center... looks smallish... MAYBE 6'10? Smart player; all-around skill... is he an nba player? Might be worth a 2nd round flyer
