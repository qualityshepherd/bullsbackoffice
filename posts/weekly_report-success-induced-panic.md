**FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE** <br>
_From the Desk of the Intern_<br>

### EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Per directive from the Señor Director, I am to inform Bulls Nation of our current organizational status: 6-1 but somehow still finding things to worry about.

### PERSONNEL UPDATES

**Giddey, Josh - Status: VINDICATION PENDING**

The Señor Director has asked me to note that he "called this" approximately 42 times since his acquisition. Current performance metrics suggest Mr. Giddey is good at basketball. Formal _"I Told You So"s_ will go out by the end of the week.

**White, Coby - Internal Crisis Alert**

We would like to address the emerging narrative that our best player—who has not yet played a game this season—is somehow... a problem? We understand this contradicts decades of Bulls fan training—where hope must be identified and destroyed—but Mr. White's expected production remains what leadership considers _"desirable"_.

### ORGANIZATIONAL POSTURE

This office finds itself in the unusual position of being correct. Again. The Señor Director has requested I maintain our signature humility while also making it clear that he has been on several _"islands"_ that have since become at least peninsulas, if not thriving tourist destinations.

### PROJECTIONS

7-1
