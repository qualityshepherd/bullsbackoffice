This one feels different.

Not because the trade was bad; it was. Collin Sexton, Ousmane Dieng, and three second-rounders for a 26-year-old guard averaging 20.4 points on 60% true shooting is objectively terrible value.

But that's not why this hurts.

### The Setup

The Bulls drafted Coby White 7th overall in 2019 as a combo guard. High-usage scorer at UNC, lightning-quick, streaky shooter with real upside. He was never supposed to be Chris Paul. He was supposed to be... Coby White. A scoring guard who could create his own shot and provide secondary playmaking.

Instead, they tried to make him a point guard.

Not his game. Never was. But the organization needed a floor general, and they decided the rookie with the speed and the assist numbers would figure it out. He didn't. Because he's not a point guard.

And the fanbase turned on him immediately.

### The Hate

Go back and read Bulls forums from 2020-2022. "Coby can't run an offense." "Coby is a chucker." "Coby's defense is terrible." "Coby will never be more than a sixth man."

Some of it was fair - he was raw, inconsistent, and yes, playing out of position. But the narrative calcified into something uglier: *Coby White is a bust.*

Meanwhile, he's stuck behind Zach LaVine and DeMar DeRozan. Two ball-dominant scorers eating up possessions. Coby's relegated to spot-up duty and garbage minutes. He develops anyway: the handle tightens, his three-point percentage climbs, his decision-making improves, his finishing gets better.

Few noticed. Fewer cared. 

### The Breakout

LaVine and DeRozan leave. Finally, Coby gets his run. Real minutes. Real usage. The starting job.

**2023-24 Season:** 19.1 PPG, 5.1 APG, 4.5 RPG on 57% TS, FT% climbed to 90.2%.

He wasn't just good; _he was the engine_. He finished **2nd in Most Improved Player (MIP) voting** behind Tyrese Maxey by just 14 total points. He went from averaging 9.7 PPG to nearly 20 while playing the 3rd most minutes in the league. He didn't just "step up"; he evolved.

**2024-25 Season (Before the Trade):** 20.4 PPG, 4.5 APG on **60.1% TS**.

Even better. The efficiency jump was the real story. 60% True Shooting is the "All-Star" threshold for high-volume guards. He proved that the previous year wasn't a fluke; it was a baseline. He was more confident, his handle was tight, and his finishing at the rim—once a weakness—became a legit weapon.

This is what he was supposed to be all along. A high-volume scorer who can playmake when needed. Exactly what the Bulls drafted him to do. In theory. In practice, they were about to fuck it all up.


### The Slump

Coby suffered a calf strain during summer workouts and missed the entire preseason. Then the first 11 games of the regular season. When he finally returned in mid-November, he was on a minutes restriction. Playing cautious. Never getting into rhythm.

Then he strained the *other* calf. Then re-injured the *original* calf in late December. Back on minutes restriction. Sitting out back-to-backs. Playing 25 minutes per game instead of his usual 35+.

He was clearly not himself. Fighting through injury. Never healthy enough to find his flow.

But the fanbase? They didn't see "injury-plagued season." They saw confirmation. "See? We were right. He's not that good. He's inconsistent. He's mid. He's Lavine. Trade him a bag of chips."

Never mind the two years of evidence showing he'd developed into a legitimate starting guard. Never mind that he was literally playing hurt. Never mind that every player struggles when they can't stay on the court. Dummies. 

Hate won. 

And then the front office lost faith. Maybe they thought he would walk in free agency... maybe his performance dip this year mattered more than his two years of proven production. ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯


### The Liquidation

So the front office sends him home to North Carolina for Collin Sexton (worse at literally everything), Ousmane Dieng (a 23-year-old project), and three second-round picks that will never matter. No center. No win-now piece. No future star. Just... meh.

Coby White - the guy who survived being miscast, survived the hate, survived being buried on the depth chart, and finally became exactly what this team needed... is gone for nothing.

### Why This Matters

This isn't just a bad trade. This is organizational malpractice compounded by fanbase amnesia.

Coby White spent five years developing into a 20+ PPG scorer on elite efficiency. He did everything the organization asked: played out of position, accepted bench roles, worked on his game, waited his turn. And the second he proved himself, they traded him. And the fanbase never forgave him. 

**Charlotte just got a starting-caliber guard for scraps because Bulls fans couldn't let go of 2020.**

I hope Coby drops 30 on us every time we play Charlotte. I hope he makes an All-Star team. I hope every person who shit on him has to watch him thrive somewhere else. 

He deserved better.

**Coby White was good. You just never wanted to admit you were wrong about him.**
