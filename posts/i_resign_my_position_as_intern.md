**BULLS FRONT OFFICE MEMO:**  
*From the Desk of the Intern*

You just traded a 26-year-old guard putting up 20.4 PPG on 60% TS for [Collin Sexton](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/s/sextoco01.html) (worse at everything), [a 23-year-old project](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/d/diengou01.html), and three second-rounders that won't crack the rotation.

[Coby White](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/w/whiteco01.html) - the guy this fanbase FINALLY stopped shitting on because he proved everyone wrong - is gone for NOTHING.

You needed a CENTER. You got another undersized guard and a 6'10" wing who can't shoot.

Charlotte is ONE GAME BEHIND US. You just made them better and us worse. This is a tank. Just SAY it's a tank instead of pretending you know what you're doing.

Coby deserved better. His fans deserved better.

Fuck this trade. Fuck the process. Fuck the Front Office. 

**I'm done writing reports for a front office that can't comprehend them.**

**Effective immediately, I resign.**
