I don't want to write this. And not because I half expected AK to trade Bulls Back Office for a 2nd round pick. Nor because [this should be the Intern writing this](#post?s=i_resign_my_position_as_intern). It's because when I remove my feelings for the Coby trade, it's clear the FO sees [Jaden Ivey](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/i/iveyja01.html) as the Coby replacement. _And they might be right._ 🥹


### The Eye Test

Watch Ivey play for five minutes and it's obvious: the athleticism is different. Body control. First-step. The kind of tools you can't teach. He's also clearly not trusting the leg yet. Coming off a broken fibula (January 2025) and a separate knee scope (October 2025), he's playing cautious. Taking fewer risks. You can see it in how he attacks; _when_ he goes, he's efficient... he's just going less.

### The Numbers Tell the Story

**Jaden Ivey 2024-25 (Detroit, 30 games before injury):**
- 17.6 PPG on 56.77% TS
- 40.9% from three
- 28% ONBALL usage
- **26.49% usage**

**Jaden Ivey 2025-26 (Detroit, 33 games post-injury):**
- 8.2 PPG on 56.96% TS
- 37.2% from three  
- 17% ONBALL usage
- **20.27% usage**

That ONBALL drop is the smoking gun. He went from 86th percentile in on-ball creation to 5th percentile. Detroit turned him into a spot-up shooter. His assisted 3s spiked from 74.6% to 88.1%. His assisted 2s jumped from 42.5% to 57.9%. His rim attempts cratered from 4.3 to 1.6 per game. His free throw attempts dropped from 3.9 to 1.1.

But here's the tell: His 2P% improved from 49.03% to 53.27%. His TS% stayed at 56.8%. When he did attack the rim, he was MORE efficient than his breakout year 🤔 The tools are there. The opportunity wasn't. AK is betting he can get back to that 86th percentile.

### The Calculation

Here's what AK is betting on:

**Coby White (26 years old):**
- 20.4 PPG on 60% TS when healthy
- Recurring calf issues all season
- Unrestricted Free agent after 2025-26
- Market value: ~$20M+ annually

**Jaden Ivey (24 years old):**
- _Restricted_ free agent 
- $12M qualifying offer keeps him cheap
- 6'4" with 6'9" wingspan 
- If he gets healthy, you've got 17+ PPG on good efficiency with better defensive upside than Coby

**The bet makes sense:**
- Younger
- Cheaper  
- More defensive upside
- Contract control

**The front office did the math. Will it add up? ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯**

### Why I Hate Admitting This

Because the rest of the moves are still bullshit:

- Trading Ayo for Rob Dillingham and Leonard Miller
- No starting center
- Six guards eating $96M in salary
- Tanking too late to get franchise-altering picks

**Getting the Ivey-for-Coby swap right doesn't excuse the rest of the disaster.** But I can't pretend the logic doesn't work. If Ivey gets healthy—and that's a big if—this is the right basketball move. Younger, cheaper, more defensive upside, under team control.


### Bottom Line

Jaden Ivey at 24 with elite athleticism, solid tools, and RFA control is a better asset than Coby White at 26 hitting free agency with calf problems.

The Bulls are still a mess. The Ayo trade is still indefensible. The roster construction is still chaos. **But this one move? Might actually be right.**

Fuck.
