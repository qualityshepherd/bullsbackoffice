**FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE**  
*From the Desk of the Intern*

### EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Per directive from the _Señor Director_, I have been tasked with scouting [Bennedict Mathurin](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/m/mathube01.html) as a [Coby White](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/w/whiteco01.html) replacement.

**The finding:** Mathurin isn't _bad_, he just doesn't make us better.

**The recommendation:** Keep Coby unless a trade makes us materially better, brings back assets, or fills a position of need.

**Bottom line:** The Front Office has never tried to satisfy frustrated fans; don't start now.


### THE MATHURIN REPORT

**Player Profile:**
- Age 23, 6'5" SG/SF
- 237 career games (IND)
- Contract projection: $22-25M/yr

**Production (Career):**
- 16.1 ppg, 57.0% TS, 23.5% usage
- 34.7% from 3 on 968 attempts
- 73.2% assisted threes

**What He Is:**
- Athletic slasher who gets to the rim
- Capable scorer in transition
- Has playoff experience (22 games)

**What He Isn't:**
- Elite shooter (34.7% from 3)
- High IQ decision-maker (58.7% assisted 2s - needs setup)
- Off-ball weapon (27% unassisted 3s - ball dominant)

**The Problems:**
- team defense issues
- off-ball awareness
- inconsistent motor
- doesn’t guard up a position reliably

**Player Comp:** Jordan Clarkson if Clarkson needed more help finishing; same streaky shooting, same ball-dominance, but less self-sufficient.

**Fit with Bulls:** Redundant with Giddey's creation, worse spacing than Coby, doesn't solve any actual problems.

**Grade:** C+ starter, B- microwave scorer. Not a needle-mover.

**Mathurin’s rim pressure and foul-drawing have value on teams starved for downhill scoring—Chicago is not one of them.**

### THE COBY DECISION

**Current Situation:**
- Contract year gone wrong
- Calf strain is costing him production and cash
- Coby shooting 35% from 3 this year (down from 36.8% career)
- Bulls fans ready to move on

**The Goods:**
- relocation shooting
- willingness to scale usage
- doesn’t hijack possessions

**The Numbers:**
- Career: 15.4 ppg, 56.3% TS, 36.8% from 3 (2,867 attempts)
- Age 26, entering prime
- Contract projection: $24-26M/yr

#### Strategic Options

**Option A - Keep Coby:**
- Bet on shooting regression to career 37%
- Maintain proven backcourt depth with Ayo
- Better, more versatile than Mathurin

**Option B - Trade Coby:**
- Get ASSETS (picks, young players)
- Fill POSITION OF NEED (rim protection, wing defense)
- Make team MATERIALLY BETTER (not lateral)

**Option C - Replace with Mathurin:**
- Same price ($22-25M vs $24-26M)
- Replace 3 level scorer with 2 level scorer
- Worse shooter (34.7% vs 36.8%)
- Similar production, worse fit
- **This is a dummy move**


### THE BULLS FAN PROBLEM

Many Bulls fans want Coby gone. This is not a feature, it's a bug.

Fans see one down shooting year and panic. They don't see:
- 2,867 career three-point attempts establishing true talent level
- Age 26 prime years ahead
- Actual versatility (can play on/off ball)

Meanwhile they're excited about Mathurin because:
- Grass is greener
- He dunks good (Twitter brain)
- They don't watch Pacers games

**This is why GMs exist:** To ignore reactionary fans and make data-driven decisions.


### RECOMMENDATION

**Keep Coby** unless a trade brings back:
1. Draft capital or young assets
2. Fills position of need (CENTER, wing defense)
3. Makes roster materially better

**Mathurin is not a Coby replacement**. He doesn't solve spacing, shot creation, or fit issues. He's just a different version of the same problem at the same price.
