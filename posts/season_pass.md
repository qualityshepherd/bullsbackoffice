Trading [Ayo Dosunmu](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/d/dosunay01.html) and [Coby White](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/w/whiteco01.html) mid-season for second-rounders and project players finally reveals AKME's evaluation: Coby and Ayo weren't good enough to lift the Bulls out of mediocrity. 

In prior years, both were sources of hope... but the bet is that [Josh Giddey](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/g/giddejo01.html) and [Matas Buzelis](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/b/buzelma01.html) can carry the hope flag now.

### The Real Timeline

Ayo's 26. Coby's 25. They're known commodities; solid starters who'll never be stars. Keeping them around means admitting the Bulls are stuck in permanent play-in purgatory.

Giddey's 23. Buzelis is 21. They're young enough that fans can still project stardom upon them. Young enough to justify another 2-3 years of "patience" while AKME figures it out. Or more importantly, young enough to sell tickets on potential instead of results.

Coby was the best player on last year's team. It was his squad. But he came into the season hurt which tanked his value. And when the Bulls won a few games without him, AKME's lightbulb flickered: "We don't need Coby to do this". But "this" was just the Bulls catching the league flat-footed. A streak that evaporated the second the rest of the league got in shape.

### Butts in Seats

The calculation seems to be: Bulls fans won't pay to watch Ayo and Coby grind out 40-win seasons. But they might pay to watch Giddey and Buzelis "develop." It's _hope as a business model_. Draft picks and young players keep turnstiles moving even when the product is unwatchable. Ayo and Coby represented a ceiling. Giddey and Matas represent the unknown. And the unknown sells.

**And now Josh and Matas can carry that hope all the way to Ticketmaster.**

### The Yabusele Tell

AKME made [Guerschon Yabusele](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/y/yabusgu01.html) waive his $5.8 million player option for next year just to complete the trade. They wouldn't take on even modest salary for a 30-year-old rotation player who can actually contribute.

Maximum flexibility. For what? To hoard cap space while stockpiling ~~14~~ 13 second-rounders and hoping lightning strikes?

### Thirteen Second-Rounders and a Prayer

Second-round picks are lottery tickets. Most bust, a few become rotation guys, finding a star there is blind luck. Package half of them to move up five spots in the draft? Hope one becomes as good as Ayo? This isn't asset management. This is spray and pray.

The evaluation phase is over. Now it's developmental minutes for Buzelis, occasional Giddey flashes when healthy, and prayers that one of them becomes a franchise player before 2028.

Until then Bulls fans get a G-League showcase with no defensive anchor, no competitive timeline, and no plan beyond "young guys might get better."

**And they expect _you_ to pay full price for it.**
