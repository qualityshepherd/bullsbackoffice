**Topics:**
- Basketball podcast subs (Zach Lowe, Thinking Basketball, Dunker Spot...)
- Does Billy have the personnel for his system? 
- Matas Buzelis DPOY aspirations
- Coby White's calf injury
- Kevin Huerter's shooting
- Trade deadline

**Bottom line:** 
The system masks weaknesses but can't fix the lack of shooters and defenders. Deadline will reveal if AK has an actual plan or just loves flexibility.
