**FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE**  
*From the Desk of the Intern*

### EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Per directive from the Señor Director, I have been tasked with conducting reconnaissance on available centers at the trade deadline. What I discovered requires immediate escalation to leadership.

**The situation:** The Brooklyn Nets are running what appears to be the most sophisticated trade value manipulation scheme I have witnessed in my brief, unqualified tenure in speculative basketball operations.

**The target:** [Day'Ron Sharpe](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/s/sharpda01.html), a 23-year-old backup center making $6.2 million annually.

**The con:** Brooklyn is actively suppressing Sharpe's minutes while showcasing [Nic Claxton](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/c/claxtni01.html) ($97M/4yr) to inflate trade value, despite Sharpe posting _objectively superior performance metrics_.

**Bottom line:** The Nets are soft-tanking, while selling fool's gold (Claxton) and hiding actual gold (Sharpe).

### SITUATION REPORT

#### The Performance Gap

I have reviewed the [Nets' 2025-26 three-man lineup data](https://www.nba.com/stats/lineups/advanced?CF=MIN*GE*30&GroupQuantity=3&TeamID=1610612751&dir=A&slug=advanced&sort=DEF_RATING). The findings are, to use technical basketball operations terminology, _"fucking bonkers."_

**Sharpe's Best Defensive Lineups:**
- Sharpe + Williams + Saraf: 79.8 DefRtg (44 minutes)
- Sharpe + Mann + Williams: 82.6 DefRtg (32 minutes)  
- Sharpe + Wilson + Wolf: 85.6 DefRtg (59 minutes)

**Claxton's "Defensive Anchor" Lineups:**
- Claxton + Clowney + Traore: 98.3 DefRtg (55 minutes)
- Claxton + Porter + Wolf: 99.2 DefRtg (58 minutes)
- Most Claxton lineups: 100+ DefRtg 


#### The Offensive Surprise

The conventional wisdom suggests Claxton is the more polished offensive player. The lineup data suggests conventional wisdom should—at its earliest convenience—kindly go fuck itself.

**Porter + Sharpe + Clowney:** 130.7 OffRtg  
**Porter + Claxton + Clowney:** 113.2 OffRtg

**Porter + Mann + Sharpe:** 141.1 OffRtg (35.8 NetRtg)  
**Porter + Mann + Claxton:** 112.8 OffRtg (-5.1 NetRtg)

Now, I'm no mathmatician (SAT math 420), but these numbers represent what experts might call _"a significant difference?"_

#### The Minutes Conspiracy

Yes, the sample sizes are small. That isn’t an accident, it’s the strategy. This is why the Nets’ plan is so cunning. Here is where the operation becomes transparent:

Sharpe's best-performing lineups are receiving drastically fewer minutes than Claxton's inferior lineups. This is not coaching incompetence—Jordi Fernández is smarter than that. This is *deliberate roster management*.

**The Nets' Strategy (Decoded):**

1. Showcase Claxton to contenders (Warriors, Pacers) as "defensive anchor"
2. Let him accumulate starter minutes despite worse performance
3. Keep Sharpe's sample size small—less tape = less competition in trade talks
4. Trade Claxton for actual assets (picks, young players)
5. Immediately hand starting job to Sharpe, who's already better
6. Continue tanking with improved defense and $23M in cap relief

This is not just smart, it's *diabolical*. Whether intentional or simply convenient, the result is the same: Claxton’s value is being amplified, and Sharpe’s is being contained.

### RECOMMENDATION

**ACQUIRE DAY'RON SHARPE IMMEDIATELY**

#### The Fit

Sharpe checks every box we discussed in [Episode 3 of the Bulls Back Office podcast](https://bullsbackoffice.com/#post?s=e3_centers_of_attention):
- ✓ Defensive presence at the rim
- ✓ Perfect timeline match with the core  
- ✓ Cheap enough to maintain flexibility
- ✓ Physical enough to bang with Embiid/Giannis types
- ✓ Actually good at basketball (per the data)
- ✓ Passing vision for Horns and Split Action sets


### CONCLUSION

Brooklyn is running a masterclass in trade value manipulation. They are hiding their best center to preserve his low price while shopping their overpaid "starter" to teams who don't watch film.
