### The Setup:

The Bulls have just traded [Ayo Dosunmu](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/d/dosunay01.html) to the Minnesota Timberwolves in exchange for [Leonard Miller](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/m/millele01.html), [Rob Dillingham](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/d/dilliro01.html), and four second round picks. Despite being one of many moves the Bulls have made over the last 72 hours, this trade seems to hit closer to home. Maybe it is because he is the hometown kid. Maybe it is because of the frustrating return. Maybe it goes deeper than that. Let's dive in.

### The Origin Story:

Our story begins at Morgan Park High School in Chicago where Ayo Dosunmu was making noise as one of the highest rated guards to come from the city since Derrick Rose. He led Morgan Park to a 3A state title during both his junior and senior seasons and received invitations to the Jordan Brand Classic and the Iverson Roundball Classic, two of the premier high school basketball player showcases. The body of work Dosunmu created during his illustrious high school career landed him a five star rating, cementing his status as one of the country's best. His collegiate decision came down to two schools: Wake Forest and the University of Illinois. In a somewhat surprising move given the fact that they had not made the tournament in six years, Dosunmu decided to stay home and become a Fighting Illini.

Dosunmu's collegiate career started with a bang and never slowed down. In his debut against Evansville, he dropped 18 points, 6 rebounds, 4 assists, and 3 steals in what was only the beginning of a stellar career in the orange and blue. In his freshman season, Ayo earned a spot on the All-Big 10 Freshman Team and an honorable mention for the All-Big 10 Team. Coming into his sophomore year, expectations only grew as he averaged 16.6 points, 4.3 rebounds, and 3.3 assists per game. Dosunmu continued his stellar play and landed a spot on the All-Big 10 First Team by the media, and coaches in the conference recognized his play as well by placing him on the second team. Illinois finished the year 21st in the Final AP poll, but Dosunmu and the team never had the chance to compete for a national championship due to the Covid-19 pandemic.

Following his sophomore year, Dosunmu tested the waters of the NBA draft. Although he received solid feedback, he decided to pull his name out and return to the Fighting Illini for his junior year with a chance to solidify his spot as one of the all time great Illinois basketball players. After a great start to the season, Ayo delivered his signature performance on February 6th, 2021, recording a triple double of 21 points, 12 rebounds, and 12 assists putting the Illini over the top in a win against Wisconsin. He went on to have the best year of his collegiate career and led the Illini to a Big Ten Tournament Championship, the 5th ever in school history and the 1st since 2005. Dosunmu was named a consensus first-team All-American and won the Bob Cousy Award which recognizes the best point guard in the country. Following a disappointing loss in the Round of 32 to Loyola Chicago, Dosunmu declared for the NBA Draft, ending an all time great collegiate career while his professional stock was at an all time high.

After the predraft process, Ayo Dosunmu was a projected late first round pick. Although a very accomplished and talented player, Ayo was 22 years old at the time and was viewed as an older prospect which caused him to fall out of the first round on the night of the draft. Little did he know, this turned out to be a blessing in disguise and his favorite team the Chicago Bulls ended up taking him with the 38th pick in the draft. The Chicago kid and Illinois superstar was staying home and fulfilling his lifelong dream in the city that made him.

### The Rise:

Although age is what caused Dosunmu to fall in the draft, his experience is what allowed him to make an immediate impact on the Bulls. Joining a core of established veterans like Zach Lavine, Alex Caruso, Demar Derozan, Nikola Vucevic, Lonzo Ball, and young players like Coby White and Patrick Williams, Ayo understood minutes were tough to come by. He fully embraced being a role player and focused his attention on the defensive end. His commitment to being a team player and his ability to make winning plays led to more minutes and eventually on December 8th, 2021, Dosunmu made his first career start. The Bulls were an extremely competitive team in 2021-2022, and held the first seed in the Eastern Conference until Lonzo Ball's injury on January 14, 2022. The Bulls limped to the finish line, but Dosunmu had plenty of opportunity with nagging injuries to Alex Caruso and Lonzo Ball being out indefinitely. Ayo played 77 games in his rookie season and started 40 of them. He finished the year averaging 8.8 points, 3.3 assists, 2.8 rebounds and received All-Rookie second team honors. His second year in the NBA brought more of the same, as Dosunmu averaged similar numbers but continued to thrive in his role alongside Zach Lavine, Demar Derozan, and Nikola Vucevic. A notable highlight from his sophomore season: a very memorable game-winning, buzzer-beating putback layup to give the Bulls a win over the Atlanta Hawks in what was the first of many times Ayo Dosunmu got the best of the Hawks over his Bulls tenure.

Following his sophomore season, the Bulls extended Ayo to a three year/$21 million contract, retaining their young developing guard on what became a bargain of a deal. Due to the nagging injuries of Lonzo Ball, as well as a Zach Lavine injury, Dosunmu slid into the starting shooting guard spot alongside Coby White in the backcourt midway through his third season. This tandem was blazing fast and highly promising, as it looked to many as if the Bulls had found their new backcourt pairing of the future. Ayo's third season ended in a play-in loss to the Miami Heat. Unfortunately, that vision only lasted a couple of months as the Bulls traded extraordinary defender Alex Caruso to the Oklahoma City Thunder in exchange for Josh Giddey, a young, 6'8 point guard with incredible passing ability. More moves followed, as the Bulls also traded Demar Derozan to the Kings in exchange for Chris Duarte and second round picks. With a now healthy Zach Lavine, the freshly acquired Josh Giddey, and Coby White coming off of a Most-Improved Player caliber season, the backcourt was suddenly crowded and Ayo was relegated to a sixth man role for a large chunk of his fourth year in the league.

Dosunmu, being the true professional he always is, took the sixth man role in stride and continued to produce. He continued attacking and became a much improved downhill player. He stepped in admirably when teammates, such as Zach Lavine, were injured. Eventually, Lavine was traded midseason to the Kings in exchange for Tre Jones, Kevin Huerter, Zach Collins, and the rights to the Bulls own 2025 pick back, ushering in what many thought was a new era of Bulls Basketball in the post Derozan/Lavine world. Unfortunately for Ayo, his season was cut short by a season-ending shoulder injury, limiting his chance to take advantage of more opportunity after the Lavine trade. The Bulls went on to finish the regular season strong on the back of great play from Josh Giddey and Coby White, before (stop me if you've heard this before) losing to the Miami Heat in the play-in. However, despite the familiar outcome hope was not lost and things were starting to look up in Chicago.

### The Takeoff:

Going into the 2025-2026 season, the Bulls had a new outlook. They had traded Lonzo Ball for Isaac Okoro, a young defensive minded wing on a cheap contract, leaving only Nikola Vucevic as the last member of the core of Lonzo Ball, Zach Lavine, Alex Caruso, and Demar Derozan. They were younger. They were faster. Dosunmu's shoulder was healed, and he was ready to go from the jump. Stepping up for the injured Coby White, Ayo began what was the best season of his career. The Bulls started 5-0, and Ayo averaged nearly 15 points a night on incredible shooting splits of 57% from the field and 46% from the arc. His play improved in ways beyond the statsheet. He was cutting more. He was unstoppable getting to the rim in transition. He was making the extra pass. He was hitting clutch shots and making big plays. His game was clicking on all cylinders. At 26 years old, Dosunmu looked like a rising star in his hometown. Despite the Bulls coming down off that initial win streak and regressing to their mean of mediocrity, Dosunmu's production stayed up. His strong play continued and his value as a player rose along with it. Unfortunately, the Bulls had other things in mind for his future.

### The Extinguisher:

The dominoes fell fast:

- **February 1, 2026:** The Bulls traded Emanuel Miller to the Cavaliers in a three team trade, netting two second round picks and Dario Saric from the Kings. An expiring contract and multiple picks for a two way player. Good business.
- **February 3, 2026:** The Bulls traded Kevin Huerter and Saric to the Pistons, netting [Jaden Ivey](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/i/iveyja01.html) and Mike Conley (from the Timberwolves). A young restricted free agent with high upside for unrestricted expiring contracts. Good business.
- **February 3, 2026:** The Bulls shipped out Nikola Vucevic and a second round pick to acquire [Anfernee Simons](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/s/simonan01.html) from the Celtics. A young upside piece for an old, disgruntled center. Good business.
- **February 4, 2026:** The Bulls traded Coby White to the Hornets in a three team deal with the Thunder. The return: [Collin Sexton](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/s/sextoco01.html), Ousmane Dieng, and three second round picks. A slightly older, less talented guard on an expiring contract and second round picks for a fan favorite putting up 20+ on elite efficiency. The value started slipping.
- **February 5, 2026:** The Bulls traded Ayo Dosunmu and [Julian Phillips](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/p/phillju01.html) to the Minnesota Timberwolves for Rob Dillingham, Leonard Miller, and four second round picks.

Out of all the trades Arturas Karnisovas and the Bulls front office made this week, this one makes the least amount of sense. Over the past five or so years, the Bulls have constantly been criticized for selling their players too late after their value had shrunk to almost zero. They did it with Demar. They did it with Drummond. They did it with Caruso and maybe even Zach. A prime example: Coby White, who could have netted a first last year but instead got a much less valuable package only a year later. In Ayo's case, it almost seems like the Bulls are selling early. He was just taking off as one of the best role players in the league, and the Bulls couldn't even get a first round pick for him? He might not have had the national recognition he deserved yet, but that was certainly on the way. Instead the Bulls acquired a small young guard who could not find minutes over a small, respectfully washed up, Mike Conley, and a G League player in Leonard Miller in exchange for their rising, much improved, guard in Ayo Dosunmu. Before the deadline, the Bulls had decisions to make as is. Coby White and Ayo Dosunmu were pending unrestricted free agents, and although the Bulls had money to sign them, committing to the backcourt of Tre Jones, Josh Giddey, Ayo Dosunmu, and Coby White without having seen real team success is a questionable decision. From that standpoint, trading Coby and Ayo away makes sense. However, in return they received two unrestricted free agent guards who will draw similar market prices as Coby and Ayo and on top of that a third restricted free agent guard as well. The Bulls will need to pay some of these players and will be doing so on a small sample size with how they fit next to the current core pieces in Giddey and Matas Buzelis. The Bulls have not simplified their offseason. They have not improved their current trajectory. They are simply staying on a similar course with new names and a truckload of second round picks attached.

### Conclusion:

Ayo Dosunmu is well on his way towards being a top of the line role player in the league. The Timberwolves, a contending team, realized this fact, and took a swing, trading young players who were never going to see the floor for them and have shown very little at the NBA level in exchange for Dosunmu. This trade is a steal for Minnesota, and feels like an overcorrection of the Bulls long-standing tradition of waiting too long to make a move. With many expiring contracts still on the table for the Bulls, this offseason will be extremely telling with how this team will look moving forward, and it is very hard to judge these current moves until free agency hits. The Bulls must get better at asset management moving forward, and Ayo Dosunmu should be a prime example of what not to do. Thank you Ayo for all the memories on and off the court. Chicago legend forever.
